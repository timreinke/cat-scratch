This project provides some structure and patterns for using io-ts, xstate, immer, and React in
a single-node multiuser application. State-preserving live-reload is setup and there are
some utilities for generating and editing parts of the project. There are APIs for building editor
components, operating on the source, that provide a more structured editing experience than free-form.
It comes with basic deployment scripts that set up single node deployments in Digital Ocean, AWS, and others.
